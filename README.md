# Eurofurence Mobile App (Backend) 

- We use Swagger to define our API & data models.
  - You can find the [API Definition YAML](https://github.com/eurofurence/ef-app_backend/blob/master/Swagger/ApiDefinition.yml) in this repositoryn, and [edit it directly with the Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/?import=https:%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Feurofurence%2Fef-app_backend%2Fmaster%2FSwagger%2FApiDefinition.yml).
  - You can us [SwaggerUI](https://app.eurofurence.org/swagger/) to interactively play with the development backend in your browser.
- Our production backend is located at https://app.eurofurence.org/api/ - it will return data (~3 months before of a convention usually fresh data, otherwise from last year) to test and design against.
